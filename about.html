                                Dialogue is the distinguishing feature of democratic societies which are judged by the extent to which governments open up to citizen involvement in public affairs and the space they give for citizens to hold the government accountable. PDF thus provides a unique opportunity for policymakers and policy takers to gather and talk with, not at each other, on the issues that affect Kenyans and collectively reflect on progress made in enhancing the development and realization of democracy. It also allows the citizens to hold the relevant institutions accountable, and to collectively identify the structural reforms that are necessary for the growth of the economy and the improvement of the people’s welfare.

Festivals are the fuel through which Kenyans have accustomed to not only celebrate unity in diversity but also amplify the needs of the nation through creative arts. PDF is premised on the understanding that knowledge and democracy are more than just written rules and institutions and thus seeks to promote democratic development through an infusion of art and dialogue. Throughout PDF, art in all its various forms – spoken word, graphic arts, creative arts- is honored and celebrated and used as the means through which people are brought together to dialogue on various issues. Renown artistes take part in PDF, utilizing their talent to bring to the fore issues and simplify debate on complex issues/challenges afflicting society. The festival mode also helps break down walls and tear down staircases of an otherwise highly stratified society that is exemplified by the gap between leaders and the led.
