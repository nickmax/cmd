The Public Finance Management (PFM) Village, hosted by Budget Talk Global (BTG), is a
dedicated dialogue space within the People’s Dialogue Festival (PDF) aimed at fostering
discussions on public finance and governance. Since 2021, BTG has engaged in public finance
conversations within the SDGs Village at PDF, but recognizing the need for a more focused
platform, it established the PFM Village in 2025. The village provides a space for in-depth
conversations on issues such as budget financing, taxation, service delivery, devolution, and

social accountability, bringing together national and county government actors, civil society
organizations, media, private sector stakeholders, and citizens. The inaugural PFM Village was
themed “From Public Budgets to Public Benefits,” emphasizing the role of public finance in
sustainable development and policy decision-making.                                    </p>

The PFM Village aims to institutionalize public finance discussions within the PDF, strengthen
collaborations among stakeholders, and raise awareness about how public finance shapes
governance and society. Through various activities such as expert panel discussions, open mic
sessions, debates, masterclasses, and digital advocacy, the village educates citizens on budget
processes and their influence on policy decisions. It also serves as a networking hub for
organizations, policymakers, and the public to engage in meaningful discourse and forge
partnerships. Ultimately, the PFM Village empowers citizens to participate in budget-making
processes and advocates for inclusive and transparent public finance management in Kenya and
beyond.                                    </p>
