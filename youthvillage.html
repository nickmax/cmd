The Youth Village, at the People Dialogue Festival, is a key segment of the Democracy Festival
that is designed to provide a platform for young adults (18-35) to engage in discussions, share
experiences and actively take part in conversations centred on issues that affect them. Through
the Youth Village, young people engage in thought-provoking discussions and activities centred
on key issues affecting their generation, with topics ranging from enhancing youth participation
in governance, socio-economic empowerment, and inclusive leadership. The village provides
room for young people, drawn from all sectors and regions of the world to dialogue on critical
societal issues, and to meaningfully register their demand for inclusive, accountable and value-
driven governance, all in the promotion of collaborative efforts for Global sustainable
development. Through a collaborative approach, the platform enables both youth-serving,
youth-led, grassroots organizations and stakeholders all across, to co-develop themes and
topics that align with young people’s needs and aspirations, through panel discussions, keynote
addresses, fireside chats, break out – mentorship sessions, debates, artistic and creative
performances like spoken words, poetry, live murals, intergenerational dialogue and
gamification of civic education, the village ensures that dialogue among young people remains
relevant and impactful, addressing priority issues in governance, social equity, and sustainable
development.
